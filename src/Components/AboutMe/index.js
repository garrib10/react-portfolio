                            My name is Brian Garrity. I am a Connecticut native born and raised in a small town called Coventry.
                            I just moved back about a month ago while living in Chicago for two years. I worked in the restaurant industry
                            while living there and got a chance to work at a Michelin Star restaurant after my first year living there.
                            I love trying new restaurants, cooking, and pretty much anything that has to do with food.

                            Currently, I am taking the UConn Full Stack Development Bootcamp. When I complete the program, I will be
                            pursing a career in web development. I have obtained a lot of skills along the way during the bootcamp, and
                            here are the some of them.
