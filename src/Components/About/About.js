          <p> My name is Brian Garrity. I am a Connecticut native born and raised in a small town called Coventry.
          I just moved back about a month ago while living in Chicago for two years. I worked in the restaurant industry
          while living there and got a chance to work at a Michelin Star restaurant after my first year living there.
          I love trying new restaurants, cooking, and pretty much anything that has to do with food.
        </p>
        <p> Currently, I am taking the UConn Full Stack Development Bootcamp. When I complete the program, I will be
          pursing a career in web development. I have obtained a lot of skills along the way during the bootcamp, and
          here are the some of them.
