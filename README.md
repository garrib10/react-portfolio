# Unit 20 React Homework: React Portfolio

For our last homework assignment, we were told to recreate our portfolio page using React. For this assignment, I created an About,Portfolio, and Contact page for my application. With each page you will see different card components with valuable information into it. I did have trouble with the gh-pages at the end and couldn't load my pictures, or my build was pushed to Github so I decided to give a heroku link for now so you can see the product for what it is. Also, it solves the issue for when I want to add changes that I couldn't do before to make my portfolio better. 

## Requirements

* Updated portfolio featuring 6 total projects

* Use React

* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

* Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring those same projects

* Deploy this site to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

* **Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to GitHub and **NOT** your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by following the above instructions and using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's code.

## Grading

| Requirement    | Weight |
| -------------- | ------ |

## Instructions

* [Updated Portfolio](#updated-portfolio)

* [Design](#design)

* [React](#react)

* [Updated LinkedIn Profile](#updated-linkedin-profile)

### Updated Portfolio

Your updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects

* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the GitHub repository

  * GIF or screenshot of the deployed application


#### Design

As with the previous portfolio homework, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

* If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note 
that this will _not_ affect your grade, but it may impact how potentials employers gauge your knowledge.

### React

Additionally, this new portfolio should be created using React.

At a minimum, your portfolio should include the following:

* A `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page 

* Navigation with React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

* A `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

* **Important**: If you use React Router, you will **NOT** be able to use the `<BrowserRouter>` component on GitHub Pages. Read the [GitHub note on client-side routing](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#notes-on-client-side-routing) and the [React Router documentation on HashRouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/HashRouter) for more information.
